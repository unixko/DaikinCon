Daikin Online/Mobile Controller Wire Harness

Daikin Online Controller (Europe) or Daikin Mobile Controller (Asia) is an adapter to bridge Daikin device to WiFi/Internet. It consists of 2 parts, a controller and wire harness for various models. For example:

BRP069A41 -> Controller Only
BRP069A42/43/45/81 -> Controller with wire harness.

It is possible to build wire harness by yourself in case like some model is not available in your country or you want to swap controller between Daikin devices. Moreover,  BRPxxxx41 model is a lot cheaper (half price of BRPxxxx81 model).

I built cable for BRP069A81 to control Daikin Sky Air unit.
